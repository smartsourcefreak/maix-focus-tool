# maix-focus-tool
Model for a 3D printed tool to easily adjust the camera focus on the Sipeed Maix Amigo

When using the Sipeed Maix Amigo as the hardware device to run Krux on, sometimes the device is shipped with a unadjusted focus where it's almost impossible to scan qr codes correctly. The .stl file in the files folder is a very simply 3d-printable tool that exactly fits the lens / focus wheel of the device and lets one easily adjust the device's focus to have quick and flawless qr scans within krux.
